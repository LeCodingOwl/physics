Bottle Flip

[Where to Play the game](https://lecodingowl.github.io/physics/)

Gameplay/Experience:
- **The game uses both continuous and discrete inputs from the player**
- **The playerâ€™s goal can only be achieved indirectly (by allowing the physics engine to move key objects into position/contact).**
- **3+ physics-based gameplay scenes (possibly implemented with a single Phaser Scene subclass).**
- **Other scenes are used to separate and contextualize the gameplay scenes**

Assets sources:
- All art was made by me using Aseprite. 

Coding sources:
- game.js, play.js, and index.html were written by Jimmy An Nguyen.
